# # Review
# create variables for the following :
# 1. age
# 2. name
# 3. song
# 4. food
# 5. number

# age = 17 **
# name = "Val"
# song = "Exit Music"
# food = "pizza"
# num = 8 **

# #now include the variables you just made print in the following...

# Once upon a time, there was a [age] old coder named [name]. 

# print(f"Once upon a time, there was a {age} year old coder names {name}.")

# [name] liked to hum the song [song] while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would throw [food] until [name] would stop singing.

# print(f"{name} liked to um the song {song} while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would throw {food} until {name} would stop singing.")

# Still, [name] was the best coder on the team and could write [number] lines of code every day. Maybe [song] was [name]â€™s secret power?

# print(f"Still, {name} was the best coder on the team and could write {num} lines of code every day. Maybe {song} was {name}'s secret power?")

# The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:
# 1. Names can not start with a number.
# 2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
# 3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+
# 4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
# 5. Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), 
#    or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
# 6. Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str"

# Here are some exercises to practice the rules:

# Correcting Invalid Names: Below are some invalid names. Correct them according to the rules:

# 1st_name
name_1st = "valeria"
# last name
# email@address
# percent%
# variable#name
# O
# list
# Creating Valid Names: Create valid names for the following descriptions:

# The first name of a person
# The last name of a person
# The email address of a person
# The percentage of marks obtained by a student
# A variable to store the number of items in a shopping cart


# Identify Valid and Invalid Names: Identify which of the following names are valid or invalid according to the rules:

# first_name - valid
# lastName - valid
# email_address - valid
# percentage - valid
# variable_name - valid
# 1_variable - invalid
# email@address - invalid 
# percentage% - invalid
# i - valid


# Declare two variables, called name and age.
# Set the name variable value to "Tony Soprano" and the age value to 51.


# Variables Practice #2
# Create three variables:
# first_name
# last_name
# full_name
# Assign the value "Julia" to first_name, and for last_name, assign the value "Roberts". Finally, build the variable full_name by concatenating these two variables (remember to add a space in between)


# Variables Practice #3
# Declare the variable course, assign it the value "Python", and print the following sentence:
# You are taking a course course
# To do this, you must concatenate the first and last parts of the sentence with the variable. Remember to add spaces before and after concatenating the variable to the rest of the text.



################ # **Working with** **numbers** **bold text**#########

# We'll learn about the following topics:
# 1. Types of Numbers in Python
# 2. Basic Arithmetic
# 3. Differences between classic division and floor division

# Python has various "types" of numbers (numeric literals). 
# 1. We'll mainly focus on integers and floating point numbers.
# Integers are just whole numbers, positive or negative. For example: 2 and -2 are examples of integers.
# 2. Floating point numbers in Python are notable because they have a decimal point in them, or use an exponential (e) to define the number. For example 2.0 and -2.1 are examples of floating point numbers. 4E2 (4 times 10 to the power of 2) is also an example of a floating point number in Python.

# slides 10 -12
num1 = 55
num2 = -55
print(num1)
print(num2)
print(num1 + num2)
print(type(num1))

#python knows a lot of number types implicityly without you telling it
# telling it(explicit)
#floats - deal w decimal numbers 
num3 = 3.14
print(num3)
print(type(num3))

#explicit types
# age = "30" **
# print(type(age))
# mom_age = int(input("How old is ur mom?"))
# print(type(mom_age))
# siblings_age = int(input("How old is your sibling?"))
# print(type(siblings_age))

# print(siblings_age + mom_age) **

# Integers Practice
# Declare a numeric variable named int_num that contains a value of integer type of your choice.
# Print the data type of that variable.

int_num = 90
print(type(int_num))

# Floats Practice
# Declare a numeric variable named decimal_num that contains a value of float type of your choice.
# Print the data type of that variable.

decimal_num = 3.1459
print(type(decimal_num))

# data Types Practice
# What type is the result of the sum of 7.5 + 2.5? Write the code to verify it.
seven = 7.5
two = 2.5

print(seven + two)

#################################Data Type conversions####################
# slides 12 -19
# Data Type Conversions Practice #1
# Convert the value of num1 to an integer and print the resulting data type.

# num1=int(7897) **
# print(type(num1)) **

#   Data Type Conversions Practice #2
# Convert the value of num2 to a float and print the resulting data type.

# num2 = float(-55.998) **
# print(type(num2)) **

# #   Data Type Conversions Practice #3
# # Add the values of num1 and num2.
# # Do not modify the value of variables already declared, but apply the necessary conversions within the print() function.

# print(num1 + num2) **

#################################formatting strings####################
# slide 19 -22


# Strings Formatting Practice #1
# We need to print the associate name and number within the following sentence:
# "Dear (associate_name), your associate number is: (associate_number)"
# Remember that the precision of your answer (spaces, spelling and punctuation) is very important to arrive at the correct result.


# associate_name = "Jesse Pinkman" **
# associate_number = 399058

# print(f"Dear {associate_name}, your associate number is: {associate_number}.") **

# Strings Formatting Practice #2
# Tell the user the amount of points earned within the following phrase:
# "You have earned (new_points) points! In total, you have accumulated (total_points) points"
# Remember that the precision of your answer (spaces, spelling and punctuation) is very important to arrive at the correct result

# new_points = 50 **
# total_points = 250

# print(f"You have earned {new_points} points! In total, you have accumulated {total_points} points.") **

# Strings Formatting Practice #3
# Tell the user the amount of points earned within the following phrase:
# "You have earned (new_points) points! In total, you have accumulated (total_points) points"
# This time, the amount of points accumulated (total_points) will be equal to the previous_points plus the new_points.
# Remember that the precision of your answer (spaces, spelling and punctuation) is very important to arrive at the correct result.

# previous_points = 875 **
# new_points = 350
# total_points = previous_points + new_points

# print(f"You have earned {new_points} points! In total, you have accumulated {total_points} points.") **

# ### Get the max and min of a number
# 11. Which is greater: 345 or 453?
# 12. Out of 1,002 and 1,020, which is the lesser number?

a = 345
b = 453
print(max(a, b))

a = 1002
b = 1020
print(min(a, b))

# ### Round a number
# 13. Round 17.56 to the nearest whole number.

# **Sqrt Method**
# 23. Find the square root of 144.
# 24. Calculate the square root of 169.
print(math.sqrt(144))
print(math.sqrt(169))

# Note: For the problems involving floor, ceil, and sqrt, students will need to use the `math` library functions in Python.


# Print on the screen the floor division of the following two numbers: 874 divided by 27

print(874//27)

# Print on the screen the modulus of 456 divided by 33

# So what have we learned? We learned some of the basics of numbers in Python. We also learned how to do arithmetic and use Python as a basic calculator. We then wrapped it up with learning about Variable Assignment in Python.
# # **Getting Input from users**
# #how do we get input from users?
# input("what is your name?")
# # basic math calculator
# #ask the user for 2 numbers
# # print out a statement where you:

ask = float(input("give me a number"))
ask2 = float(input("give me another one"))

# # add them together
print(ask + ask2)
# #multiply
print(ask * ask2)
# # find the max number
print(max(ask, ask2))
# # find the remainder of the numbers
print(ask%ask2)
# #round one number
print(round(ask))
